This program visualizes the sorting algorithms
Bubblesort, Insertionsort, Selectionsort, Mergesort.

VisualSort is written in Java and should run on most platforms.
Both cmd files serve to run it on Microsoft Windows operating systems.
Take a look at them if you want to run VisualSort on other platforms;
the syntax should look quite the same.

The file VisualSort.jar not only contains the class files but also
the source code. Since a jar file is essentially a zip archive,
popular compression utilities should be able to handle it.
